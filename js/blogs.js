  title: `PERSONAGE`,
  body: `Life, what can I say? I am only in my twenties. I barely understand it. Way too young to even make an attempt at that. Well, on some days I am certain about the things that I want. On other days such as today I become lost. So utterly lost that doubt creeps in. I doubt myself, my worth and even lose sense of every accomplishment  made. On such days life humbles. It brings me back to earth, down and  onto my knees. Such days make me emotional. On the verge of tears because I could very easily be nothing. The past no matter how elegant it was is erased. It is simply but memories. Plus, the present is no gift, it is a seemingly heavy load. The burden of life, a cursed spell cast upon me. Don't get me started on the stark darkness that is the future. Is there any chance really of figuring it out?
  Life remains a mystery to me. I know what you think. That I am young, too young to be stressed about this. That I still have so much time on my hands to still figure it out. I wonder. What if this is it? Do all my dreams and aspirations go up in flames and turn into smoke vanishingbwith the wind? Who am I? Why am I here? Do I deserve to be? Am I doing enough? I wonder if this is God's plan for me. Is He looking down on me right now and smiling? Smiling at my nature. My foolishness. Smiling at my waivering faith in Him. I think that He smiles  knowing that my race isn't run yet. That this gloom and despondency is just one of the challenges He set for me to overcome, for my being to hack life and realise His majesty. For me to grow in understanding.
  It is scary, not going to lie. I am trembling. If He is seeing this I hope that He gives me strength. Strength to hold on. Even more strength to let go. I hope that I find my way in this maze of life. That eventually, the roads travelled by those who came before me open up. That the path created for me takes shape and becomes easy to tread on. That I will not merely crawl, but absolutely walk believing in Him. He who gives me strength. Believing in myself.
  Belief that one day I will be enough. Good enough. Wise enough and old enough.For life, for someone. For ME

The serenity
My anxieties at bay
My demons away
Unlike before
She must be a witch
That's why it's hard to stay away

Presently I am high
So much power in her eyes
Not to mention caramel thighs
Though she awakens some devil
She is worthy
I have to comply
Her graces give reason

My lofty praises
I revere her
I found treasure, a home
You don't abandon home
Home is where the heart is
And she
She keeps my heart`,

  title: `LET IT RAIN`,
  body: `Someone divine, perfect and special. Her name is despondency and she is charming. Her allure is ravishing, you find it unyielding to resist. She stifles each and every existence around you. You want to fight, to be unshackled of her heavy reign. However, she extends her hand out to you. She has you trapped. Confined within her head space, the aura she exudes  strangulates you.
As you try to catch a breath, your palm is suddenly filled. Warm and snug, the feel of her devastating touch. She plays with your biology, her overwhelming existence makes you frail. You cannot control your body. Instant pandemonium sets in as your mind caterwauls in a bid to take the reins over the rest of your body.
She is shrewd, sensing the resistance arising from your mind, she hauls your head up so that you look directly at her face. Prying into the chasm of your soul, she makes your mind crash. As the mind shuts down, the body goes with it too. In an unruly fashion, your body gravitates towards her. 
In her arms. She is vicious and she has you exactly where she wanted to see you. The gaze she keeps over you is hypnotic. A great daze takes over you. Slowly but certainly darkness squirms you up. 
You try to fight it as much as you can but with a few flutters,your eyelids shut. This is a darkness you are yet to encounter. Not the orange and gold dark before a sunrise. This is the type of dark that crops up in a complete solar eclipse. All sense of light and noise is blocked out. The apprehension of being left alone in silence. Serenity first, then total oblivion. You are surely petrified.
In a quick trice, hot liquid fills up in your eyes. The certain familiar feel of tears. It's only natural. In a time of chaos and uncertainty tears are bound to surface.  Traumatized by everything that is going on, the quick and sure take down by sadness serves as a trigger to open the flood gates. Let it rain. A snuffle that turns into a sob which turns into a cry brings forth uncontrollable weeping. A grown man, a boy in the least is crying like a toddler. Tears of pain. Sadness and defeat. All the barricades you put up over the last month or so haven't held against the mighty wrath and spleen  of her. Sadness, gloom and despondency. This is not an orderly eventuality, but you choose not to defy it. All the negative emotions and sensations stockpiled finally getting a clear cut circuit out. Let it rain. Let it rain. Let it rain. The only direction. The only way to get over this. The only way to overpower her strong hold on you. 
Literally crying it out. Burst at the seams and stand to get back your freedom. Temporarily disoriented by her. As the tears start to dwindle,as the seemingly lifetime supply starts to die out, a sense of betterment takes over.
Vigour and stability. What you need. You felt so weak but now you feel so powerful. Total contrast. A beautiful kind of contrast. Using the same palm that was violated, you wipe off the tears. No more spillage. You even afford a smile, even though it is wry. You are drained. At least tonight you can sleep. You will try to fix you. Starting with a well deserved rest.

The whole point of this piece is to show how sadness feels like. How it leads to breakdowns. I haven't really brought it out too well but this is as close as I can get, at least through my own sadness. I've also tried to show how crying helps. Yes shedding tears helps.The photo is of a Syrian child asked to smile by a journalist. You can see the relevance to the piece.  `,

  title: `JUST THOUGHTS`,
  body:`It is beautiful today. The silence and peace. This is what they call inner peace I think. It's a Saturday it's pretty hot outside but I actually feel cool.
  Just from the shower. You can imagine,ice cold water in this blistering mid day heat. Oh glorious feeling. You should try it some time, especially if you are a comrade from Rongai.
  So let's talk about this feeling. This beautiful feel of ease and proper comfort. What is it about? Well, for one it's silent here. Other than the sound of water pumps humming away it's silent. 
  Silence like this brings deep thoughts. It is like a chick hatchery. You know how the environment is specially designed to help in the hatching of eggs. That's how it feels.
  The silence creates a perfect space for deep thoughts to take center stage. I think about my exploits, they aren't much. Especially when it comes to the fairer sex. Story for another day.
  Anyway, I have been thinking about my life. I know I sound cliche and outright boring. Just give me a minute to explain. That good? Okay,here we go. So,my life... What about it? For one I have been obsessing over the thought of getting a kid. A daughter to be precise.
  I think I'll make a good father. I think I've been educated enough in the matters of life to know what examples to set for her. It sounds crazy. A kid like me claiming to be experienced in the issues of life. Oh well,iny head I am experienced at least.
  Imagine the sheer joy and emotion that comes with a baby girl. Things become serious. No more drama and games. Just becoming serious so that she can have a good life. You know,like I have the chance to make a human being who will maybe one day make more humans. She'll pass on my values, my stories and my beliefs to her children. She might look like the female version of me or maybe she will take after her mother. Oh and she'll pick up things I say. She'll pick up some habits from me. Maybe even interests.
  I know I know,getting a kid is not all fun and games. I've been toying with the thought though. I don't know if it is a sign from the universe. A sign that if I am not careful in my exploits it'll reward me with a daughter. It'll make me more sensitive and wise to the importance of life and it's seriousness.I'll make me grow up. Haa now that I think about it,let me just kill that thought slowly. Choke it silently as carbon monoxide chokes man...
  Good day!

  title: `ADVERSITY`,
  body: `
  Good old rejection is at the top of that list. Often a swift punch right where it hurts. When you first met them the energy was crazy in a good way, when all the signs worked for you. They made you believe that the second party is interested. You interpreted that wrong. Fueled by false hopes and high hopes you made a move. Only that, the other person didn't see you that way. After putting your heart on the fine-thin line you end up devastated. Alone and feeling useless.
  
  Don't. Do not dare wake up. Sleep has never been better. You know it's sad, really disheartening that a few days ago you couldn't get even a wink of sleep. The passion  had demolished every single thing on it's path, regular or odd. It took hostage, made you feel its fiery flames and the terror it carries too. The dark. The silence. The chills. The hardest time to be alive, three thirty in the AM. Insomnia. Your beloved prepossessing consort who always  saddles you down. 
  
  It was heaven delivered express to you. Custom made,just how you liked it. You were so high. You were surely cruising, love was easy. Love was beautiful and it kept you going. Attraction in its virgin form, utter bliss that sometimes drove you to shear darkness and absolute dementia. 
  You couldn't see it even if it was coming straight at you. The little things you swept under the rug,the red flags you were quick to shush. They came at you, every skeleton in their closet. They didn't teach it to dance and it came out. Shattering and spattering every little lie you had believed. It went south, it died out but you still fixate. Your fetish for them makes you reminisce and now you can't get a move on. 
  
  Most if the time, you cry yourself to sleep. The seductive lust to self damage yourself tugs at your senses. It hankers you to put yourself down, right at rock bottom. Physically or psychologically cohere to it's shout out. You think you are sick. You believe that too. Your mind becomes a prison, the walls of that prison are covered in fabricated deception. It is fiction. 
  It could be different you know. If you raise your voice and speak up. If you avow that you are fragmented, panic-stricken and insecure by and about certain emotions you will get help. We all have issues, demons and battles we face everyday. That however does not mean that we are alone. Power in numbers, in the words of Alan Walker; we are unity.

  title: `POISON-ANTIDOTE`,
  body: `
  Cut me to the core. Still healing. Scars, adorn my heart. The trademark aftermath of pain curved on a fragile heart. Once more it is broken, shuttered and spluttered.

Should have kept to myself. I found trouble, that's just my fault. For being a believer, fairy tale ending. I wanted nobody but you. Here we are, like we were so far apart. 
We are both young, our paths are bound to be different. I hate this. To find a new number, a whole different stranger to fill the void.

I'm the one who partly ruined everything. I made you think it's all your fault. It takes two to tango, it takes two wreck a relationship. You and I. I held you up, so high like a flag. So proud, I thought we'd stay that way. Right now you are warming up to another negro. Another night turns to day as I search for a potential disturbance just because I want somebody like you. How to be lonely. I'm scared. Not used to being on my own. Used to being everything another person needs.

The end of us. The bitter metallic taste in my mouth, the empty feeling at the pit of my stomach. The unfamiliar but certain discomfort in my heart. The millions upon millions of questions that race through my young cluttered mind. Nothing can hit me like this. Like you do, walking a tight rope. Thin ice, afraid when it breaks I will freeze unable to catch a breath. Drowning in a bottomless pit.

I'm high like this for you. You somehow also put me down, at  rock bottom. It's alright. I picked my poison, I will get the antidote.

WHY DO I HOLD ON TO YOU?

No more listening to these stupid songs. They all remind me that you are gone. That I let you go, yet I still hold on to you. It's easy to say that I will be out of your way, but it's a whole other game to actually do it.
I still listen to these stupid songs. They all remind me that I am wrong. If this is it, I'll wish you'd stay with me. I still hold on to you. I let it get too far. As if I don't know where it all went wrong.
Memories upon memories flood my mind and floor my heart. It's easier to blame you, but I don't want to. This is on me. I'm not okay. I know I should let go but I hold on to you.

  It never fades away.
  It stays here, the feelings like broken glass inside me.
  In love there is war. Ours is a battle.
  It always ends in violence. No matter how great, no matter how sweet it was.
  
  The misery. 
  The heart break every single time.
  Surreal, that I could be this way.
  I had high hopes for us.
  I forgot. Good things fall apart. Always.
  Heck, I thought I was strong. Bulletproof vest, but I feel every bit of pain.
  
  Days go by.
  I miss you. I hate you at the same time.
  What was real? I think about you, so much so that it breaks me. Accepting is hard.
  Velvet rolled down, for you and I.
  I may never let go.
  I may never ever try.
  Am I just afraid to be alone?
  For you and I, it's do or die.

Intoxicating.
Suffocating.
Crashing.
Kill the lights. The dark will guide you on.
A drug, out of control.
Irrational. You are fading.
Go home. You are alone.
You seem to forget,that this is real life.
When you feel the pain, take it in. Flowing in your veins. Tonight, you let it sink.
Let it flow, pouring out. The dazzling bright light, the feeling of floating has gone dark.
Somehow you have to crawl out of this state. It will kill you. No right words. No sweet lies.
This has gone too far.
Burning inside. Everything you knew, desperate for a change. It is in your blood. This is what you want, what you need. Tiny cracks. All have grown into open fractures. You knew it would happen. What is happiness?
A lie you feed  your brain. Manufactured in the heart. Of course, the heart. What does it know? Hugh, it runs full speed at it. This illusion it made up. An escape to eutopia. When reality is not worth the thrill. When your heart rips at the seems. It goes into a free fall. When stars don't light.
All these questions, no choice answers.
So you are down and just about out.  No more floating, gravity holds you down. You have lost yourself. Spin out. You tried hard to make it last, but it's not supposed to be. Drop by drop, tears bring you to your knees. Perfect, perfection here and now. You know this place. Yes, you do. 
Familiar curtains, nothing too impressive. You don't know how to forget this place,how can you? Nothing new to report on. It's okay, die in your own arms. Hold yourself, as the curtains close. It's okay, this is right where you are supposed to be. Lay yourself down on the ground. Unending flow of tears. 
It's okay. As long as you are with you, you aren't alone. You will never be.
Cross your heart.
Hope to die.
Till the end, the ends of time

  Alone I was cruising
  In my lonely heartbreak ship
  Then you jumped on board
  You seemed worth the shot
  Claiming you'll stay for good
  
  I gave you not just my heart
  I gave up my body too
  To you who who'd care for me
  Such a shame it ended how it did
  
  Even now I wonder why
  Why you took me in
  If you were not to keep me
  In my eyes you were perfect
  
  What is perfect though
  An illusion we feed our minds
  You played me for a fool
  You were my obsession
  
  It was him that you saw
  Him that you thought about
  Him that you missed the most
  Even when we talked all night long
